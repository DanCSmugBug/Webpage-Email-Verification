The first bit of this project was made as a small challenge for a web development course I have been taking online. As with most of my
javascript/jquery webpages, it's been mainly used for learning the ins-and-outs of the systems.

This particular project was styled and formatted to look like a newsletter sign up. Overall, it's a fairly straight forward project,
however I added in a few additional jquery flourishes to make it look slightly more professional, such as text fades for the error and
confirmation messages, and some custom artwork. Overall I'm quite pleased with it, and in the end I added in a little extra that the
course didn't do, such as verifying the phone number to be an appropriate length and not posting redundit error messages (I avoided
posting an error for both no information available and for fields being incorrectly submitted). I think in the future I might go back
and add in a requirement in length and characters for the password, like most password creation requires.

It should be noted that this bit of code still has a lot of limitations to it. Currently it doesn't produce an account or add anything to
a mailing list.

Update: Quickly just added in further password verification, including password length and verifying that there is a special character.
No more weak passwords will be made for this fake account!
